TOTP (RFC 6238)
===============

TOTP is a simple, compact and bare-bones PHP class for calculating [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) tokens using the SHA1 default, commonly used for two-factor authentication with mobile apps such as Google Authenticator. It comprises three public functions of which only one is necessary to call to get a token.


Usage
-----

Simply call `TOTP::getOTP( $secret [, $digits = 6 [, $period = 30 [, $offset = 0 ]]] )` which returns an array with the key `otp` holding the authentication token, or the key `err` describing an eventual error.

The other two functions are meant to be convenient utilities:

`TOTP::genSecret( [ $length = 24 ] )` generates a TOTP-compatible pseudorandom secret in Base32 ASCII, returning an array with the key `secret` holding the random secret or the key `err` describing an eventual error.

`TOTP::genURI( $account, $secret [, $digits = null [, $period = null [, $issuer = null ]]] )` returns an array with the key `uri` holding an `otpauth://` style URI providing the supplied parameters, which can f.e. be embedded in a QR code image, or the key `err` describing an eventual error.
